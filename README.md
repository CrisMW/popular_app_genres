# Popular app genres on Android and iOS
## Identifying profitable genres to guide future development of free apps relying on ad revenue
----------------
In this project, I'll look at a sample of about of 10,000 Android apps and 7,000 iOS apps to find out which genres of free apps are most popular. This info could guide our decision making if we were to develop apps based on advertising revenue. The more popular its genre, the more money likely an app is to make us money.

To determine popularity, I focus on two measures: the share of all apps that a genre takes up, and the average number of users per app for a genre. My analysis shows that the popular genres differs quite a lot between Android and iOS. However, the genres 'Weather' and 'Productivity' represent a good compromise because they are very popular on one system and somewhere in the middle on the other.
